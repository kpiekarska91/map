# Free Map for 3 Different Brands Using OpenStreetMap and CodeIgniter with OpenLayers


## Project Overview

This project is designed to create a free map based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) for three different brands. It uses the CodeIgniter framework for the backend and the OpenLayers (ol) library to visualize and interact with the map. Each brand has its own data layer, displaying various locations (points, lines, polygons) and allowing for management through the API and user interface.


## System Requirements

The project is based on the following JavaScript packages:

- PHP 7.4+ (for CodeIgniter)
-  Node.js and npm
-  MySQL (or another compatible database)
-  CodeIgniter 4.x
-  Vite for frontend build tooling
-  OpenLayers for map rendering

## Features

1. Interactive OSM Map - Displaying the map using OpenLayers with navigation and layer management.
2. Support for Three Brands - Each brand has its own layer with unique data (locations, categories).
3. Geocoding - Searching for locations using addresses via ol-geocoder.
4. Location Management - Adding, editing, and deleting locations for each brand.
5. Dynamic Data Loading - Loading geographical data for brands from a MySQL database via the CodeIgniter API.
6. Optimized Build - Using Vite and Webpack for fast builds and production deployment.
